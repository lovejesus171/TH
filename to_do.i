I have to modified the kernels

I have to implemented the non neutrality near boundary!

I can do this by using the combination of NPP (Nernst-Planck Poisson equation)

Now I have to remove permissivity from Nernst-Planck kernel.

I have to add permissivity into SEF kernels (solution electric field) which represents Poisson equation to calculate potential distribution (potential of electrolyte or solution)
