# Argon Microdischarge

This example is based on a [ZDPlasKin example of an argon microdischarge at atmospheric pressure](http://www.zdplaskin.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/index.html@p=310.html). The model includes five species: Ar, Ar$^*$, Ar$^+$, Ar$_2^+$, and electrons. The number density versus time is shown in the plot below, with ZDPlasKin's results for comparison.

The reactions are included in the input file as shown below:

Rate coefficients are separated from the reaction notation by a colon character. If a rate coefficient is enclosed in brackets, it will be added as a parsed function. (Note that this may incur a slight performance penalty, but the benefit is that any functional form may be included.) Variables that are added as constants inside the function must be noted with the `equation_values` parameter, and the values assigned with `equation_values`. Any nonlinear or auxiliary variables must be specified with the `equation_constants` parameter.

!alert note title=Plot Differences
The profiles are not identical. The main difference between ZDPlasKin and CRANE is that a Boltzmann solver is not dynamically coupled to CRANE, but [BOLSIG+](http://www.bolsig.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/) is coupled and run with ZDPlasKin. Instead, electron-impact rate coefficients are tabulated prior to runtime.
