# CRANE Examples - Global Discharges

Running CRANE as a standalone software will allow users to model global systems of equations. While the software is intended to be used with chemical kinetics, it may also be used to model any system of first-order ODEs. The following examples cover both general ODEs and chemical kinetics.
