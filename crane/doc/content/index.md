### 'Human Readable' class=center style=font-weight:200;

CRANE was developed with readability in mind. Chemical reactions may be added 
exactly as they would be written by hand, and the program will parse the reactions
into the appropriate source terms automatically.

### MOOSE-based application class=center style=font-weight:200;

CRANE is built on the MOOSE framework, and as such may be used effectively on both workstations and 
high-performance computers. It may be used by itself as a global chemical kinetics solver, or it can 
be coupled into other MOOSE applications.

### Coupled to Zapdos class=center style=font-weight:200;

CRANE has been natively coupled to [Zapdos](https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos) and has been used 
to study multidimensional plasma discharges with complex chemical reaction networks.
